The function has two-bit inputs A and B. Also, the function has two one-bit inputs known as input S and input E.
These inputs output a two-bit output named Q. The output of Q will be a high impedence value if E is 0. However,
 if E is 1, it will check if S is 1 or 0. If S is 1, then Q will equal A. If S is false, then Q will equal B.
